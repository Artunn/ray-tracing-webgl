The images that show the features are included which are rendered with light position 0.1,0.6,-0.5.
The images display how the red sphere moves along the z direction, where the light source is above
the spheres.

We implemented reflection with shadows and shading recursion by depth.
We couldn't implement refraction and multiple light support.

Spheres can be opaque or reflective(mirror-like).
